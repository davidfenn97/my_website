I have had the privilege of studying in some fine institutions. For my secondary education, I attended Blackrock College in Dublin. 

After leaving Blackrock in 2016, I then enrolled in Univesity College Dublin where I studied Business & Law, graduating in 2020.

During my year break before coming to LBS, I also completed Level 1 of the CFA exams.

I am now studying in London Business School for a Masters in Financial Analysis.
