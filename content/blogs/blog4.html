<p>I am fortunate to have done lots of travel.It has always been a passion of mine.</p>
<p>Over the last few years I have had the privilege of Inter-railing across Europe twice, backpacking South East Asia, visiting the US, travelling extensively across France, Spain and Portugal and even got to visit the Blue Lagoon in Iceland.</p>
<p>Now that restrictions are lifting I am very excited to get back out and see the world again.</p>
